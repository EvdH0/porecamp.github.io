PoreCamp 2015
14th December - 18th December 2015

University of Birmingham, UK

PoreCamp is a training bootcamp based around Oxford Nanopore
MinION sequencing. It is a unique opportunity to learn about
this exciting new sequencing platform from some of the leading
experts in the field. 

PoreCamp will be entirely hands-on and the relatively high
cost of entry reflects the costs of running the course;
participants will have hands-on exposure to sequence library
preparation, operation of the MinION and small group
interactive bioinformatics teaching.
